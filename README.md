This is a simple Streamlit web app that allows you to explore the services running in a Kubernetes cluster. You can select a namespace and retrieve a list of services running in that namespace.

## Requirements

To run this script, you will need:

- Python 3
- The `streamlit` and `kubernetes` Python packages
- Access to a Kubernetes cluster

## Installation

Before you can run the app, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies. You can do this using pip:

```
pip install streamlit kubernetes
```

## Running the App

To run the app, simply execute the following command in your terminal:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

Replace `app.py` with the name of the Python file containing the code.

Once the app is running, you should see a web page that allows you to select a namespace and retrieve a list of services.

## Code Explanation

The code is written in Python and uses the following libraries:

- `streamlit` - for building the web app
- `kubernetes` - for interacting with the Kubernetes API

The code does the following:

1. Loads the Kubernetes configuration using `config.load_kube_config()`
2. Creates a Kubernetes API client using `client.CoreV1Api()`
3. Defines a function to list all services in a given namespace
4. Defines a Streamlit web app that allows you to select a namespace and retrieve a list of services
5. Runs the app using `streamlit run app.py`

The app works by allowing the user to select a namespace from a dropdown menu. If the user clicks the "List Services" button, the app retrieves a list of services running in the selected namespace using the `list_services()` function. The services are displayed in a table on the web page.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
